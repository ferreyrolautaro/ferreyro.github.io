  <h1>00. The start</h1>
  <p>I'm a product designer, among many other things — my interests and the various roles I take on every day make a simplistic statement unjust.</p>

  <h2>01. Experience</h2>
  <p>My professional journey has been shaped by the trust and opportunities extended to me since the moment I sent my first cold email. I’m deeply grateful to those early collaborators and clients who believed in my work and helped lay the foundation for my career.</p>

  <h1>02. Collaboration is progress</h1>
  <p>I believe in Bitcoin as a valuable asset, in open-source code as a collective engine, and in design as the origin of every great idea.</p>

  <h1>03. Less noise, please</h1>
  <p>Overcommunication distances us from genuine human connections and the invaluable free time that contemplation demands, which is essential if one wants to truly attempt to understand things.</p>

  <h1>04. Adding value</h1>
  <p>My interest is in products and services that solve concrete problems, as opposed to false promises of changing the world or to those that only serve to feed prevailing narcissism.</p>

  <h1>05. Pursuing knowledge</h1>
  <p>Friends, colleagues, and family are my constant sources of inspiration, driving me to strive to become smarter every day. They are the reason for my evolution.</p>
